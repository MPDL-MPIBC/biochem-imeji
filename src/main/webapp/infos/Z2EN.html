<h2>Z2</h2>
<div align="justify">
	The Z2 was a <a href="./mechanicalSystem" target="_self">mechanical</a> and <a href="./relay" target="_self">relay</a> computer created by <a href="./zuse" target="_self">Konrad Zuse</a> in 1939. It was an improvement on the <a href="./z1" target="_self">Z1</a>, using the same <a href="./mechanicalSystem" target="_self">mechanical</a> memory but replacing the arithmetic and <a href="./logicGate" target="_self">control logic</a> with <a href="./electromechanics" target="_self">electromechanical</a> <a href="./relay" target="_self">relays</a> circuits.<br />
	The realization of the Z2 was helped financially by Dr. Kurt Pannke, who manufactured small calculating machines. The Z2 was completed in 1939 and presented to an audience of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f&uuml;r Luftfahrt ("German Laboratory for Aviation") in 1940 in Berlin-Adlershof. In this presentation the Z2 actually worked and could convince the DVL to partly finance the next design (namely the <a href="./z3" target="_self">Z3</a>). The machine, photographs of it and constructions plans for the Z2 were destroyed by the Allied bombing during World War II.<br /><br />

	Zuse designed the <a href="./z1" target="_self">Z1</a> in 1935 to 1936 and built it from 1936 to 1938. The <a href="./z1" target="_self">Z1</a> was wholly <a href="./mechanicalSystem" target="_self">mechanical</a> and only worked unreliably. Helmut Schreyer advised Zuse to use a different technology: As a doctoral student at the Berlin Institute of Technology in 1937 he worked on the implementation of <a href="./booleanAlgebra" target="_self">Boolean operations</a> and <a href="./logicGate" target="_self">logic gates</a> on the basis of <a href="./vacuumTube" target="_self">vacuum tubes</a>. In 1938 Schreyer demonstrated a circuit on this basis to a small audience, and explained his vision of an <a href="./electronics" target="_self">electronic</a> computing machine &ndash; but since the largest operational <a href="./electronics" target="_self">electronic</a> devices contained far fewer <a href="./vacuumTube" target="_self">tubes</a> this was considered practically infeasible.<br />
	Zuse asked the German government for funding to replace the <a href="./relay" target="_self">relays</a> with fully <a href="./electronics" target="_self">electronic</a> switches, but funding was denied during World War II since such development was deemed "not war-important". Zuse decided to implement the next machine (the <a href="./z3" target="_self">Z3</a>) based only on <a href="./electromechanics" target="_self">electromechanical</a> <a href="./relay" target="_self">relays</a>. In contrast to the <a href="./z1" target="_self">Z1</a>, the Z2 used 16 <a href="./bit" target="_self">bit</a> fixed point arithmetic instead of 22 <a href="./bit" target="_self">bit</a> <a href="./floatingPoint" target="_self">floating point</a>.<br /><br />
