<h2>Binary Number</h2>
<div align="justify">
	In mathematics and computer science, the binary numeral system (or base-2 numeral system) represents numeric values using the two symbols 0 and 1. Numbers represented in this system are commonly called binary numbers. Counting in binary is similar to counting in any other number system. Beginning with a single digit, counting proceeds through each symbol, in increasing order. Decimal counting uses the symbols 0 through 9, while binary only uses the symbols 0 and 1. When the symbols for the first digit are exhausted, the next-higher digit (to the left) is incremented, and counting starts over at 0. This is known as carrying. When the result of an addition exceeds the value of a digit, the procedure is to "carry" the excess amount to the left, adding it to the next positional value. In binary, counting is the same except that only the two symbols 0 and 1 are used. Thus after a digit reaches 1 in binary, an increment resets it to 0 but also causes an increment of the next digit to the left:<br /><br />
	0000, <br />
	0001, (rightmost digit starts over, and next digit is incremented) <br />
	0010, 0011, (rightmost two digits start over, and next digit is incremented) <br />
	0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, (rightmost three digits start over, and the next digit is incremented) <br />
	1000, 1001, ... <br /><br />

	Any number can be represented by any sequence of <a href="http://zuse.zib.de/imeji/bit" target="_self">bits (binary digits)</a>. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital circuitry using <a href="http://zuse.zib.de/imeji/logicGate" target="_self">logic gates</a>, the binary system is used internally by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices such as mobile phones.<br /><br />

	All computers built by <a href="http://zuse.zib.de/imeji/zuse" target="_self">Konrad Zuse</a> used the binary notation for numbers.<br /><br />
