<h2>Electromechanics</h2>
<div align="justify">
	In engineering, electromechanics combines electrical and <a href="./mechanicalSystem" target="_self">mechanical</a> processes. Devices which carry out electrical operations by using moving parts are known as electromechanical. Strictly speaking, a manually operated switch is an electromechanical component. The term however is usually understood to refer to devices such as <a href="./relay" target="_self">relays</a>, which allow a voltage or current to control other, isolated voltages and currents by mechanically switching sets of contacts by which a voltage can actuate a moving linkage. <a href="./relay" target="_self">Relays</a> originated with telegraphy as electromechanical devices used to regenerate telegraph signals. Before the development of modern <a href="./electronics" target="_self">electronics</a>, electromechanical devices were widely used in complex circuits, including electric typewriters and teletypes, and up to the complexity of an electromechanical digital computer.<br /><br />

	Electromechanical <a href="./logicGate" target="_self">logic gates</a> can be build with <a href="./relay" target="_self">relays</a>. The <a href="./z3" target="_self">Z3</a> and the <a href="./z4" target="_self">Z4</a> were electromechanical machines which employed <a href="./relay" target="_self">relays</a> in all of their functional units. In contrast the <a href="./z2" target="_self">Z2</a> used both <a href="./mechanicalSystem" target="_self">mechanical</a> and electromechanical means for different functional units. The <a href="./assemblyLineSelfReplicatingSystems" target="_self">Assembly Line Self-Replicating Systems</a> envisioned by <a href="./zuse" target="_self">Konrad Zuse</a> are electromechanical constructions.<br /><br />
