<h2>Assembly Line Self-Replicating Systems</h2>
<div align="justify">
	For <a href="./zuse" target="_self">Konrad Zuse</a> "self-replicating systems" were an advanced manufacturing concept that he envisioned in 1957. With this concept he wanted to achieve the <a href="./electromechanics" target="_self">electromechanical</a> automation of  manufacturing processes to implement customized building projects. He presented the idea of a universal factory, which gets raw materials and energy as input and has various products as output. A universal factory could be capable to produce its own means of production by itself and reproduce itself. The fabrication parts could be self-produced in an automated manufacturing process. Such a process would have to self-produce the respective parts as well as conduct their assembly in a closed unit. Such a manufacturing system could be a self-reconstructing machine. This machine could always reproduce its own structure. Zuse further mentions by reaching this level of technology the manufacturing processes could be influenced in such a way, that increasingly complex manufacturing facilities would arise.<br /><br />
