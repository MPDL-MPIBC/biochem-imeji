	A logic gate is an arrangement of switches and can be constructed using <a href="./mechanicalSystem" target="_self">mechanical</a> components, <a href="./relay" target="_self">relays</a>, <a href="./vacuumTube" target="_self">vacuum tubes</a> or <a href="./transistor" target="_self">transistors</a>. A logic gate is a physical device implementing a <a href="./booleanAlgebra" target="_self">Boolean function</a> such as the logical AND, OR and NOT operations. A logic gate performs a logical operation on one or more inputs, and produces a distinct single output. The implementation for each Boolean operation requires a different design of the respective logic gate. Thus an AND gate has to be build in a different way from an OR gate. Some operators are implemented by breaking them down into a logically equivalent combination of 2 or more other logic gates. Logic gates can be cascaded in the same way that <a href="./booleanAlgebra" target="_self">Boolean functions</a> can be composed to produce more complex logic functions.<br />
	The output of a logic gate can be feed back as input and thereby other logic gates can be controlled. This makes the digital machine perform a 'sequence' of operations. The simplest sequential system is probably a flip-flop, a mechanism that represents a <a href="./binaryNumber" target="_self">binary</a> digit or "<a href="./bit" target="_self">bit</a>". Logic gates today are primarily implemented using diodes or <a href="./transistor" target="_self">transistors</a> acting as <a href="./electronics" target="_self">electronic</a> switches. Microprocessors are composed of logic circuits, which may contain more than 100 million gates.<br /><br />
	
	<a href="./zuse" target="_self">Konrad Zuse</a> built the <a href="./z1" target="_self">Z1</a> using <a href="./mechanicalSystem" target="_self">mechanical</a> logic gates. After building the <a href="./z1" target="_self">Z1</a> Helmut Schreyer advised <a href="./zuse" target="_self">Konrad Zuse</a> to use <a href="./vacuumTube" target="_self">vacuum tubes</a> for the <a href="./z2" target="_self">Z2</a> in favor of <a href="./mechanicalSystem" target="_self">mechanical</a> means. <a href="./zuse" target="_self">Zuse</a> decided to use <a href="./relay" target="_self">relays</a> instead because <a href="./electronics" target="_self">electronic</a> components were too expensive for him at that time. The <a href="./z2" target="_self">Z2</a>, <a href="./z3" target="_self">Z3</a> and <a href="./z4" target="_self">Z4</a> therefore utilized <a href="./relay" target="_self">relay</a> logic gates.  The Z22 was the first computer developed by <a href="./zuse" target="_self">Konrad Zuse's</a> company that used <a href="./vacuumTube" target="_self">vacuum tube</a> logic gates. With the Z23 they were substituted with <a href="./transistor" target="_self">transistor</a> logic gates which were employed in all following computer models such as the Z31.<br /><br />
